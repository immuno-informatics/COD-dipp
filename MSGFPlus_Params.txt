#Fragmentation Method
#  0 means as written in the spectrum or CID if no info (Default)

#Instrument ID
#  0 means Low-res LCQ/LTQ (Default for CID and ETD); use InstrumentID=0 if analyzing a dataset with low-res CID and high-res HCD spectra
#  1 means High-res LTQ (Default for HCD; also appropriate for high res CID).  Do not merge spectra (FragMethod=4) when InstrumentID is 1; scores will degrade

#Isotope error range
#  Takes into account of the error introduced by choosing non-monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#  Useful for accurate precursor ion masses
#  Ignored if the parent mass tolerance is > 0.5Da or 500ppm
#  The combination of -t and -ti determins the precursor mass tolerance.

#Amino Acid Modification Examples
# Specify static modifications using one or more StaticMod= entries
# Specify dynamic modifications using one or more DynamicMod= entries
# Modification format is:
# Mass or CompositionString, Residues, ModType, Position, Name (all the five fields are required).
# CompositionString can only contain a limited set of elements, primarily C H N O S or P

# Examples:
#   C2H3N1O1,  C,  fix, any,         Carbamidomethyl    # Fixed Carbamidomethyl C (alkylation)
#   15.994915, M,  opt, any,         Oxidation          # Oxidation M (mass is used instead of CompositionString)
#   H-1N-1O1,  NQ, opt, any,         Deamidated         # Negative numbers are allowed.
#   CH2,       K,  opt, any,         Methyl             # Methylation K
